## About the assignment

In this assignment, I would summarize 2 webpages to translate them into readble words by html2text and use these wordcloud. And I will put it on my website and  update it at 9:00 A.M. everyday.


## Installation

Use  `git clone`  to clone the repository from github to local sever.

* *html2text* should be installed to convert html files to readable text files. Below is the install code.

```
cd ~/bin
git clone https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text 
cd html2text
mv html2text.py ~/bin.
```
* *wordcloud*  could be used transform words to a image.  Below is the install code.

```
cd ~/bin
git clone https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud.git
```
As for people who don't have permission to install wordcloud , you should modify your directions to
`python -m pip install --user wordcloud`
to install it locally.

## Customize the website

```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<body>
<h1>Website</h1>
<p>Hi, below is a live wordcloud generated by [www.nytimes.com] and [www.vogue.com], and it will update everyday.<p>
